# tkinter
> Strictly speaking, tkinter is simply the name of Python’s interface to Tk—a GUI library originally written for use with the Tcl programming language and developed by Tcl’s creator, John Ousterhout. Python’s tkinter module talks to Tk, and the Tk library in turn interfaces with the underlying window system: Microsoft Windows, X Windows on Unix, or whatever GUI system your Python uses on your Macintosh. The portability of tkinter actually stems from the underling Tk library it wraps.

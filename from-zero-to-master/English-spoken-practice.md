### Part Two: What do you like doing?
**Pattern**
1. In every sentence, after 'like', we use a verb plus -ing.
2. But just using 'like' can be repetitive and boring. So what other verbs can you use?
3. Well, you could use verbs like 'love', 'enjoy', or 'hate'.
4. You can also add words like 'really', 'sometimes', or 'absolutely', to make your meaning stronger or weaker.
**You can say just like**
1. **In my free time, I like** relaxing with my family.
2. **I love** going swimming.
3. **I enjoy** watching TV.
4. **I hate** going shopping.
5. **I really like** taking photos.
6. **Sometimes, I enjoy** going jogging.
7. **I absolutely hate** playing football.

### Practice
1. I really like playing tennis. I play every weekend at the park near my house. Sometimes I play with my brother, or sometimes with a friend. My brother got me into it, because he loves sports and he needed someone to play with. I didn't like it at first, because it was hard and I lost all the time, but now I enjoy it, especially when I beat my brother!
2. I love taking photos. Once or twice a month, I go to different areas of the city and look for interesting pictures to take. I've been interested in photography since I was young, when my dad got me a camera for my birthday. I like it because it's creative and I can express myself through my pictures. Anyone can use a camera, but you need to use your imagination to find good pictures.

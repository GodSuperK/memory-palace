# English Spoken Practice

## 1. Talking about your free time and hobbies

### Part One: Free time and hobbies vocabulary
1. What words do you know for free time activities in English?
2. Some people prefer things you do at home, like **watching TV**, **reading**, or **cooking**.
3. Other people like sports, like **playing football**, **playing basketball**, **playing tennis**, **going swimming**, **going jogging**, or **going climbing**, or maybe **doing boxing**, **doing judo**, or **doing yoga**.
4. Of Course, many people prefer more social activities, for example, **hanging out with your friends**, **relaxing with your family**, or **going shopping**.
5. Or maybe you like to do something more creative, like **taking photos**, **painting**, or **writing stories** or **writing a blog**.
6. What about you?
7. What kind of free time activities do you prefer?

### Part Two: What do you like doing?
**Pattern**
1. In every sentence, after 'like', we use a verb plus -ing.
2. But just using 'like' can be repetitive and boring. So what other verbs can you use?
3. Well, you could use verbs like 'love', 'enjoy', or 'hate'.
4. You can also add words like 'really', 'sometimes', or 'absolutely', to make your meaning stronger or weaker.
**You can say just like**
1. **In my free time, I like** relaxing with my family.
2. **I love** going swimming.
3. **I enjoy** watching TV.
4. **I hate** going shopping.
5. **I really like** taking photos.
6. **Sometimes, I enjoy** going jogging.
7. **I absolutely hate** playing football.
Now it's your turn. What can you say? Can you make your own sentences? OK, so now you can say something about what you like or don't like doing.

### Part Three: Adding details to your ideas
1. First, let's say how often you do your free time activity.
2. I like playing sport. I play football **every Tuesday evening**.
3. I absolutely hate going shopping. I only go shopping **once or twice a year**.
4. I really like taking photos, but **I don't get the chance to do it often**.
5. **Every** ...
  - Every weekend.
  - Every Saturday afternoon.
  - Every day.
6. **Once/twice a** ...
  - Once a week.
  - Twice a month.
  - Three times a year.
7. Next, let's add some details about where you do your hobby or free time activity.
8. I like playing sport. I play football every Tuesday evening **at the park near my house**.
9. I enjoy having coffee with my friends. We go **to a cafe in the city centre** once or twice a week.
10. I really like taking wildlife photos **in the forest**, but I don't get the chance to do it often.
11. Next, let's look at giving background information, especially if you have an interesting or an unusual hobby. You can talk about when and why you started doing it.
12. **I started** playing tennis **when I was** ten.
13. **I've been** learning to paint **for** six months now.
14. **I decided to do** yoga **because** I wanted to be healthy.

### Question

### Practice
1. I really like playing tennis. I play every weekend at the park near my house. Sometimes I play with my brother, or sometimes with a friend. My brother got me into it, because he loves sports and he needed someone to play with. I didn't like it at first, because it was hard and I lost all the time, but now I enjoy it, especially when I beat my brother!
2. I love taking photos. Once or twice a month, I go to different areas of the city and look for interesting pictures to take. I've been interested in photography since I was young, when my dad got me a camera for my birthday. I like it because it's creative and I can express myself through my pictures. Anyone can use a camera, but you need to use your imagination to find good pictures.
